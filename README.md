# 🚀 IBM Cloud Watsonx.ai – Jupyter Notebook Setup  

This repository documents my first hands-on project where I created and executed a **cloud-based Jupyter Notebook** using **IBM Cloud + Watsonx.ai**.  

---

## 📌 Project Overview  
I built an AI/ML environment on **IBM Cloud**, configured **Watsonx.ai Studio + Runtime**, and successfully executed **Python code** inside a Jupyter Notebook.

## 🔑 Step-by-Step Process  

### 1️⃣ Login to IBM Cloud  
- Signed in with IBM credentials  

### 2️⃣ Select Watsonx.ai Service  
- From *Catalog* → *AI/ML* → **Watsonx.ai**  
- Picked the **Lite (Free) Plan**  

### 3️⃣ Create Watsonx.ai Studio & Runtime  
- Studio instance = workspace for AI/ML projects  
- Runtime = compute resources (CPU + RAM + preconfigured libraries)  

### 4️⃣ New Project Setup  
- Named the project & added description  
- Attached free **Cloud Object Storage**  

### 5️⃣ Associate Runtime with Project  
- Connected Watson AI Runtime under *Manage → Services & Integrations*  

### 6️⃣ Define Execution Environment  
- Created a custom environment template (e.g., 1 vCPU, 4GB RAM)  

### 7️⃣ Launch Jupyter Notebook  
- Created a new Notebook inside Watsonx.ai Studio  
- Wrote & executed Python code  

### 8️⃣ Upload & Access Data  
- Uploaded datasets into project storage  
- Inserted auto-generated IBM Cloud dataset access code
